# Connect4
This project is a Connect 4 game in Java. 
You can play 3 different AI CPU levels or play against a friend.
The game runs in terminal.

I built two classes: Token and Board.
The Board class includes functions to check for win, valid moves, and get next AI move.

To run the game:
* Download the code
* Compile and run Connect4.java in Terminal/Command Prompt
